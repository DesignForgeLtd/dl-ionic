For the front-end we use Angular + Ionic + Capacitor. The idea is to use the same codebase for Web, Android, iOSâ€¦ and maybe more.

Set-up steps:

1. Clone repository from: https://github.com/DesignForgeLtd/dl-ionic or git@github.com:DesignForgeLtd/dl-ionic.git

2. Install Ionic: https://ionicframework.com/docs/v3/intro/installation/ 

3. In project root in terminal run: npm install

4. To start app, also in terminal, run: ionic serve


*** THIS IS ONLY A FRONT-END AND 
GAME WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT AN API ***
